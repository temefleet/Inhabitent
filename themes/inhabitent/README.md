# Inhabitent Theme

Inhabitent WordPress theme is the number one theme for hipster camping stores which don't actually exist. 

Studies have shown that non-existant stores are less likely to create green-house emissions, thus this theme is environmentally friendly by eco-friendly hipsters who talk about hugging trees but probably never actually do it.

## Installation

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Type in Inhabitent in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
